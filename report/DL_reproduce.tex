% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break

\begin{abstract}

This is a report paper of the deep learning module. We reproduced the main parts of an oral paper in ICLR 2019, names ``ImageNet-trained CNNs are biased towards texture; increasing shape bias improves accuracy and robustness''.

\section{Introduction}


\section{Data}

\subsection{16-classes ImageNet data set}
We downloaded the famous ImageNet data set. It contains 1000 classes of images and each of the classes has about 1000 pictures. This data set is too big for us, thus we choose 16 classes of them as listed in the paper. The 16 classes are knife, keyboard, elephant, bicycle, airplane, clock, oven, chair, bear, boat, cat, bottle, truck, car, bird, dog. Each of these classes has 1300 pictures which is still too big since we would introduce stylized images in the following section which multiply the number of images by 8.

Hence our final
